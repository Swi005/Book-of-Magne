\chapter*{Preface}
    The goal of this script is to provide an overview of the course INF222 at the University of Bergen.\\
    It is by no means a comprehensive guide to the course, but rather a supplement to the lectures and exercises.\\
    This was all written throughout a weekend and there is probably a whole lot wrong with the text and the code, so if you find any errors, please let me know by submitting a ticket or pull request on GitHub.\\
    The Glossary is especially lacking. Due to the time constraints, I was not able to update all terms in the glossary, so if you find a term that is not defined, or seems wrong, please let me know.\\
